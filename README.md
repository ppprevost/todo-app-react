# Todo App React

This is a simple app that allows you to keep track of your tasks and to-do items. 

With my app, you can add new items to your to-do list, mark items as complete, and remove completed items from your list.

To get started, simply clone this repository from GitHub and run it on your device. Once the app is running, you can start adding items to your to-do list by clicking the "Add" button at the bottom of the screen. 

Don't forget your login and pass to access !! 

To add an item simply fill inside the upper input then press enter. 

To Edit an existing item, click on the text of the todoList.

To mark an item as complete, simply click on the checkbox in your to-do list. This will strike through the item and move it to the completed section of the list.

To remove an item from your completed list, click on the "trash" icon button at the right of the TodoItem.

We hope you enjoy using my TodoList app! 

Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

# Limitations
The app does not currently sync with external servers, so your to-do list will only be available on the device you are using. It's using local Storage and MSW to mock a server
